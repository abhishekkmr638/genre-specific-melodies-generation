# genre-specific-melodies-generation
This project is an application of Deep Learning model RNN-LSTM which is used to generate continuous sequences learned from previous sequences. The model is implemented in music in midi format which provides sequences as notes and as a result future notes are predicted in order to create a new set of music which contaons the essence of that specific genre by or LSTM trained model. The model is trained for each genre of the music and was able to generate music resembling that particular genre it was trained on.  With the ability to generate melodies based on a specific genre, a personalized music can be generated for each person based on their data about their genre preference.
